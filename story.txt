Once upon a time, there was a perplexing[o] question that had been vexing[v] the minds of many: Who came first, the egg[n] or the chicken[n]?

The debate raged on for ages, until one day a wise old[o] sage[n] said, "I can solve this conundrum with ease! Let's ask the great and powerful Fleazle[n]!"

So off they went[v], searching high and low[o] for the mystical[o] creature[n]. Finally, they found Fleazle[n] in a far-off glen[n].

Fleazle[n] proclaimed[v], "I know the answer to this dilemma! The egg[n] came first[o], for it was the chicken's[o] breakfast[o]!"

The crowd was flabbergasted[o]! How could Fleazle[n] know such a thing?

"It's simple[o]," said Fleazle[n], "The chicken[n] needed something to eat[v] before it could lay[v] any eggs[n]!"

The crowd was in awe[o]. This had to be true[o]!

And from that day forward[o], the answer to the age-old[o] question was clear[o]: the egg[n] came first[o]!

Now, whenever someone asks this perplexing[o] question, the answer is always the same[o]: The egg[n] came first!
