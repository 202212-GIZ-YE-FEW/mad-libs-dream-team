Once upon a time, there was a perplexing[a] question that had been vexing[v] the minds of many: Who came first, the egg[n] or the chicken[n]?

The debate raged on for ages, until one day a wise old[a] sage[n] said, "I can solve this conundrum with ease! Let's ask the great and powerful Fleazle[n]!"

So off they went[v], searching high and low[a] for the mystical[a] creature[n]. Finally, they found Fleazle[n] in a far-off glen[n].

Fleazle[n] proclaimed[v], "I know the answer to this dilemma! The egg[n] came first[a], for it was the chicken's[a] breakfast[a]!"

The crowd was flabbergasted[a]! How could Fleazle[n] know such a thing?

"It's simple[a]," said Fleazle[n], "The chicken[n] needed something to eat[v] before it could lay[v] any eggs[n]!"

The crowd was in awe[a]. This had to be true[a]!

And from that day forward[a], the answer to the age-old[a] question was clear[a]: the egg[n] came first[a]!

Now, whenever someone asks this perplexing[a] question, the answer is always the same[a]: The egg[n] came first!
