Once upon a time, there was a perplexin' question that had been vexin' the minds of many: Who came first, the
egg or the chicken?

The debate raged on for ages, until one day a wise ol' sage said, "I can solve this conundrum with ease! Let's
ask the great and powerful Fleazle!"

So off they went, searching high and low for the mystical creature. Finally, they found Fleazle in a far-off
glen.

Fleazle proclaimed, "I know the answer to this dilemma! The egg came first, for it was the chicken's
breakfast!"

The crowd was flabbergasted! How could Fleazle know such a thing?

"It's simple," said Fleazle, "The chicken needed something to eat before it could lay any eggs!"

The crowd was in awe. This had to be true!

And from that day forward, the answer to the age-old question was clear: the egg came first!

Now, whenever someone asks this perplexin' question, the answer is always the same: The egg came first! It's a
lesson that everyone should learn!
